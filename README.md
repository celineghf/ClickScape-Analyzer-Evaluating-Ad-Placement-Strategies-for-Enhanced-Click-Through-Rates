The research article, “Navigating the Clickscape,” delves into the impact of ad placement on a website’s click-through rates (CTR). Over a two-week study on a prominent news website, the focus is on CTRs for the sports footwear brand “ZoomRunners.” Ads are strategically placed in the left sidebar, center, and right sidebar, with rotation every three hours to mitigate time-of-day bias. The dataset covers ten days, capturing user responses to webpage layouts with three different ad locations.

On each day of observation, the dataset records the CTR for each ad placement, providing insights into the fluctuations of user engagement during the research period. In this context, the CTR is calculated as the ratio of clicks per one hundred impressions, serving as a metric to assess how effectively the ads attract user attention and stimulate responsive actions.
